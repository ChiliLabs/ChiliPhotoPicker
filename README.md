# ChiliPhotoPicker

Made with ❤️ by [Chili Labs](https://chililabs.io).

Library made without DataBinding, RxJava and image loading libraries, to give you opportunity to use it without additional dependencies.

![](images/example.gif)

- Picker styled as bottom sheet dialog
- Could be used for single or multiple photos pick
- Allows to choose how images are loaded into ImageView
- Takes responsibility for all needed permissions
- Takes responsibility for fetching gallery/camera result
- Have two built-in themes - Light and Dark
- Easy custamizable


| No permission                   | Single choice                      | Multiple choice                   |

## Setup

Gradle:

Add Jitpack to your root `build.gradle` file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add dependency to application `build.gradle` file,the latest [release version](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/releases):

```
 implementation 'com.github.AbdulrahmanGamal:ChiliPhotoPicker:0.3.5'
```

## Usage

Initialize `ChiliPhotoPicker` in your `Application`'s class `onCreate`
- `loader` - your preferred `ImageLoader` implementation (ready examples for Glide and Picasso are [here](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/chiliphotopicker/loaders))
- `authority` - your file provider authority. Is needed if you set `allowCamera` to `true`, so picker could store temporary photo from camera

``` kotlin
ChiliPhotoPicker.init(
        loader = GlideImageLoader(),
        authority = "lv.chi.sample.fileprovider"
    )
```

Create new instance of `PhotoPickerFragment`
- `multiple` - true for multiple image pick, false for single
- `allowCamera` - true to show Camera button, false to hide
- `maxSelection` - limit images count to pick
- `theme` - built-in or custom theme (by default `ChiliPhotoPicker.Light` is used)
- Show as dialog

``` kotlin
PhotoPickerFragment.newInstance(
        multiple = true, 
        allowCamera = true,
        maxSelection = 5,
        theme = R.style.ChiliPhotoPicker_Dark
).show(supportFragmentManager, YOUR_TAG)
```
Notes:
Picker will throw exception if:
- `loader` was not initialized
- `authority` was null while accessing camera

### ImageLoader

We don't want to depend on many image loading libraries, so we have simple `ImageLoader` interface, which you can implement using your preferred library (Glide, Picasso, Coil, etc.)
We have two working examples of `ImageLoader` implementations - using [Glide](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/chiliphotopicker/loaders/GlideImageLoader.kt) and [Picasso](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/chiliphotopicker/loaders/PicassoImageLoader.kt). You can just copy one of them or write your own implementation

### Callback

Picked photos URIs are returned via callbacks `onImagesPicked` function, so you just need to implement `PhotoPickerFragment.Callback` interface in your activity or fragment

### Themes

To customize picker you can use one of [built-in themes](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/photopicker/src/main/res/values/themes.xml) or inherit it rewriting [attributes](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/photopicker/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml) you want (see [example](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/res/values/styles.xml))

Attributes:
- `pickerBackgroundColor` - background color
- `pickerPrimaryColor` - primary picker color (no permission/empty texts, cancel icon)
- `pickerSecondaryColor` - secondary picker color (snackbar)
- `pickerControlColor` - color of buttons, icons, checkboxes, ripple
- `pickerGalleryIcon` - drawable for Gallery icon (to remove it use `@null` as attribute value)
- `pickerCameraIcon` - drawable for Camera icon (to remove it use `@null` as attribute value)
- `pickerCornerRadius` - background's corners radius
- `pickerDividerColor` - color of line below Gallery/Camera buttons

### Localization

It's difficult to translate library to each language, so default strings are on English, but you can easily override them. Example for common strings and plurals are [here](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/res/values/strings.xml). All strings used in library can be found [here](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/photopicker/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
